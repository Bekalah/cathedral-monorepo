# üî¨ Cathedral Research Mode - Complete Documentation

## Overview

The Cathedral Research Mode provides deep integration with authentic mystical practices from history's greatest fusionist masters. This is **real** angel tech, art-science fusion, and living research - not simulation or roleplay, but genuine spiritual technology based on historical practices.

## üß¨ What is "Angel Tech"?

**Angel Tech** refers to the systematic approach to consciousness development pioneered by Antero Alli, building on Timothy Leary's 8-circuit brain model. It's called "Angel Tech" because:

1. **Angels as Consciousness Circuits**: Each circuit corresponds to different "angelic" or higher-frequency states of consciousness
2. **Technology of Transcendence**: Systematic methods for navigating between reality tunnels
3. **Vertical Oracle**: Techniques for accessing guidance from "higher" circuits of awareness
